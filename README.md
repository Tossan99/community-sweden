We're thrilled to introduce you to our community-driven website, designed to support and enhance your journey through the Code Institute course. As a community passionate about learning and collaboration, we've created this platform to empower everyone to participate in coding and gain a deeper understanding of Django.

## Table of Content

## Conventions to Follow

### Double or Single Quotation Marks
- We use `double quotation` marks for the outer quotes and `single quotation` marks for quotes within quotes. Ex: let string = "This is a 'string' with a quote"

### Spacing
- We use `4 spaces` for `indentation`.

### Urls
- The best `URLs` are clearly named and should almost be possible to be guessed by users. So, choose a structure that makes sense for this project. The About Us page may live at the `about/` `URL`, whereas logging into your site may live at `accounts/login/`.
- Although it may be tempting, it is best not to give your `URLs` the same name as your `view function` or vice versa. So, our `blog/` `URL` would not call a `view function` named blog.

### Branch / Fork

Before you start working on this project, create your own branch by clicking "branches" and then then green "new branch" button. Then you can open the branch in your IDE.
