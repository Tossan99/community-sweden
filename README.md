## Conventions to Follow

### "" and ''

### Spacing
- We are using `4 spaces` for `indentation`.

### Urls
- The best `URLs` are clearly named and should almost be possible to be guessed by users. So, choose a structure that makes sense for this project. The About Us page may live at the `about/` `URL`, whereas logging into your site may live at `accounts/login/`.
- Although it may be tempting, it is best not to give your `URLs` the same name as your `view function` or vice versa. So, our `blog/` `URL` would not call a `view function` named blog.

## env.py
- DM one of our members on slack to get access to the `env.py` file and its keys.
